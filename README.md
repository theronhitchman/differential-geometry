# Differential Geometry Course Notes and Web Site

This is the source repository for a set of course materials for Math 3630/5630:
Differential Geometry at the University of Northern Iowa.

Material is a mix of latex, markdown, and SageMathCloud .sagews files.

Created in Fall 2014, further work in Spring 2018.

This branch (shifrin-solutions) contains the source files for my solutions to the book _Differential Geometry: A First Course in Curves and Surfaces_ by Ted Shifrin. The 2018 Spring version of the book is [available here](http://www.math.uga.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/ShifrinDiffGeo.pdf).

Work on this started with the 2011 Spring version. Latest updates happen with the January 2018 version.
