For our first meeting, we considered two problems about parametrized curves.

### Task 1:

In the diagram below, use \\(t\\) as a parameter and find a parametric description
of the unit circle less the point \\( (-1,0)\\).

### Task 2:

A ribbon of length 10 inches is wrapped around a cylinder of diameter 1 inch. We
slowly unwrap the ribbon while keeping it taut.

* a. Where is the end of the ribbon just as it comes free?
* b. What path does the end of ribbon trace as you unwind it?


## For Wedesday, January 21:

For next time please do the following:

+ Read section 1.1 from Shifrin. This is pages 1-8.
+ Read section 1.1 and 1.2 from Struik. This is pages 1-10
+ Do Shifrin exercises 1-5 on page 8.


#### How did I make that image?

I used Sage. This time with the [Sage Single Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/),
which is good for quick work. My code for this plot is:

    c = circle((0,0),1)
    l1 = line([(1,-1),(1,1)])
    l2 = line([(-1,0),(1,2/3)], linestyle="--")
    t = text("(1,t)",(1.15,2/3), fontsize=10, color='black')
    (c+l1+l2+t).show(figsize=[3,3])
