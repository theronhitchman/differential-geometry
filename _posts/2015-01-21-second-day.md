title: Parametrized Curves 1
---

We first talked a litle bit about "leveling up," and about how to read mathematics
effectively (use a pen; work along; do extra examples by yourself; reread multiple times).

Then students presented. Christine took up Task 1. Sladana handled Shifrin 1.1.1.
Corbyn did Shifrin 1.1.2, Mark did Shifrin 1.1.4, and Jesse M. did the first half of Shifrin 1.1.5.
We ran out of time before Jesse could finish, so we will pick up there next time.

### For Friday, January 23:

+ Figure out how to graph some of the curves (hint, use SageMathCloud).
+ Do Shifrin 1.1 \# 2, 6-9
+ Finish Task 2
