title: Parameterized Curves 2
---

We made some more progress today on parameterized curves.

Jesse M finished his work on Shifrin 1.1.5. Emily did Shifrin 1.1.2, and Corbyn
did Shifrin 1.1.7.

This involved a few discussions about what is really going on with reparameterizing
a curve by arclength.

### Some Resources

A previous time I taught this course, I wrote up some things I talked about with
students. Maybe these things can help you.

+ A post about [why we parametrize curves](http://theronhitchman.blogspot.com/2013/02/differential-geometry-of-curves-why.html)
+ A post about [arclength parametrization](http://theronhitchman.blogspot.com/2013/02/reparametrization-and-arclength.html)
+ A post about [regularity for curves](http://theronhitchman.blogspot.com/2013/02/parametrized-curves-whither-regularity.html)

Oh, and here is an example of a SageMathCloud worksheet with a simple plot in it.

### For Monday, January 26:

+ Do Shifrin 1.1 \# 6, 8-10
+ Do Task 2
+ Reread the previous material on the basics of parametrized curves.
