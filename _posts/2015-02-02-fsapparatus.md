We spent some time in discussion today where the students checked their work
on lots of example calculuations together.

Then we went on and discussed other things previously assigned.

Mark did Shifrin 1.2.4; Corbyn did Shifrin 1.2.5; Gustavo did Shifrin 1.2.6.

I talked a little bit about parameterizations and the FS-equations again.
These equations (which describe how our frame moves) will take up a central
role in our study for the next few weeks.

\[
\left\{\begin{array}{ccccc}
T'& = & & \kappa N & \\
N'& = & -\kappa T & & \tau B \\
B'& = &  & -\tau B &
\end{array}\right.
\]

For next time, please work on Shifrin 1.2.7-11 and Struik 1.6 \#3,4.
