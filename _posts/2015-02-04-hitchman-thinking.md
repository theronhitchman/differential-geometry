title: Hitchman Takes a Turn

---

Today Emily asked me to show how I start to think about one of these tasks.
There is value in watching an "expert" figure stuff out, so I did it.
The task in question was exercise 1.2.10 from Shifrin. This ended up taking the whole hour, so we didn't do anything else. I'll put a copy of my "solution" below, but it doesn't have the thinking part in it.

To help out with the thinking parts:

  * What examples do I know that I can model my understanding on? (In this
    case it was easy to pick out our canonical helix.)
  * How can I use the Frenet-Serret equations to make progress? Is there a
    differential equation nearby that I can use to my benefit?
  * When stuck, take a derivative.
  * In "theoretical" setups, it almost always helps to assume your curve is
    parameterized by arclength.

**I want to talk about project ideas!** look through the lists on the web page, think about what you might want to study. Come talk to me to sort it out. It is time to get moving on those.

**It is time to write up some solutions!** We haven't talked about this enough. See the grading table for "motivation."
