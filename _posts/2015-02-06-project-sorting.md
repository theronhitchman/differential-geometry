title: Project Sorting Day

---

Today we discussed two exercises from Shifrin. Corbyn did 1.2.11, which was a
patient and careful computation. Mark did 1.2.8, which showed that a curve
which has all of its normal lines through a fixed point must be a planar
circle. This used all three of the "big tricks" from classical differential
geometry. In order.

  * When nothing else is obvious, take a derivative;
  * the Frenet-Serret equations are your friends; and
  * remember that \\(\{T, N, B\}\\) is always an orthonormal basis of space.

We then discussed project ideas. I figured that you might want some help choosing appropriate projects, so I did this:

| Name      | Project                                                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Emily     | Tangent Spherical Image                  |
| Christine | Bertrand Mates                           |
| Gustavo   | Pedal Curves                             |
| Corbyn    | The Darboux Vector                       |
| Jesse M   | Cauchy-Crofton formula and applications  |
| Jesse T   | The Locus of Centers                     |
| Mark      | Curves on quadric surfaces               |
| Sladana   | The Bishop Framing                       |
| TJ        | The Four Vertex theorem and its converse |

We still haven't talked about Shifrin 1.2 \# 7, 9 and Struik 1.6 \# 2-4.
Please prep those for next time.
