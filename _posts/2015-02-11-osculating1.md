title: Osculating Structures

---

I spent some time discussing the intricacies of the argument that justifies calling the osculating plane the "plane through three consecutive points."

The Sladana did Struik 1-6 \#3. Emily took on Struik 1-6 \#11, which I think needs a little more attention. It is the same tricky kind of thing that I had just discussed.

Next time we'll have the "computational fluency for curves" exam in class. Bring a pencil.
