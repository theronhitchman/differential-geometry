title: The Normal form for curves

---

Today we took time to talk a bit more about the detail for curves. Emily
finished Struik \\(S\\)1-6 \#11 and we learned the new vocabulary word
_vertex_. A _vertex_ is a point where \\(\kappa'=0\\), and this connects with
the task Emily did by seeing the radius of the osculating circle seems to be
not changing at that point.

Then we discussed \\(S\\) 1-6 \#8, with Corbyn taking the lead. His argument
was inspired by the mean value theorem arguments we have been making, but
viewed in reverse. I gave an alternate that used just the Frenet-Serret
equations. These amount to the same thing, though, and I see no reason to
prefer one over the other.

Then I filled time by discussing the "normal form" for a curve. The idea is
to use Taylor's theorem to third order, but then plug in what you know from
our later study. This allows us to build pictures of projections of a curve
on its three standard framing planes: the osculating plane, the normal plane,
and the rectifying plane. They gives us alternate ways of thinking about
curvature and torsion.

I posted broken links last time, so I'll clean those up. For friday, I want
to talk about involutes and evolutes. I'll post an update with some tasks to
do later this afternoon.
