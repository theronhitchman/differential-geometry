Short discussion of Involutes and Evolutes today. I hope we can finish this up
and move on to surfaces next week.

Also, my pile of "reworked exam papers" is suspiciously light. I did not get all
that I expected today. :(  Those need to be turned in Monday at the latest. It
is important to me.

Oh, and Jesse and Mark probably want a new curve for the Involute/Evolute project
because the arclength reparametrization for the curve I gave them is known to be
impossible to compute with elementary functions. Either you can figure out how to
maneuver around this (As I think about it, Jesse was on to something. That might
work!) or you can try a different curve.

If you pick a different curve, pick a non-planar curve that is not a helix.
