title: Last Day of Curves

---

Today was our last day of talking about only curves as a class. We discussed how
integration (like when computing arclength) really is a difficult problem, and we
have made up names of functions to describe some integrals that we understand.
Names like \\(\ln x\\), \\(\sin x\\), and \\(e^x\\). Many of you ran across
"elliptic integrals" and these are similar, but of the next level of complextity.

I still have **three** exam rewrites that were not turned in. I want those ASAP.

We will start talking about surfaces next time. Please read section 2.1 of Shifrin and sections 2-1 through 2-2 of Struik, and start the exercises in Shifrin section 2.1. You will begin presenting those next meeting.
