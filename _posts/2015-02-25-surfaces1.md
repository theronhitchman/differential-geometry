title: surfaces, part I

---

Today we began our study of surfaces. We talked about the basic picture of a parametrized surace: with \\(u\\)-curves, \\(v\\)-curves, tangent vectors, tangent plane, normal vectors, and the first fundamental form.

We discussed the first few items out of Shifrin section 2.1: Sladana presented on number 1, and Emily did number 3 parts c and d. Corbyn wanted to do number 2, but we ran out of time.

Keep going!
