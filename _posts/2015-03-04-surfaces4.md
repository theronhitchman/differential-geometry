title: More Surface Basics

---

We discussed more of the exercises from Shifrin on the basics of parametrized surfaces.

Christine did \#4c; Mark did \#5; Jesse M did \#6; and Emily did \#8.

I want to keep pushing through this stuff till we feel comfortable with parametrized surfaces, the first fundamental form, area, angles, and lengths. Let's finish Shifrin \\(\S\\)2.1 problems 9--14, and also do Struik \\(\S\\)2-3 \#1-13 (pages 64 and 65).

I hope projects are going well. I have talked with a few of you, but not all. Are your projects going well? Let me know.
