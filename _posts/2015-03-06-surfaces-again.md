title: Surfaces, Again!

---

Today we talked more about basic geometry on surfaces. We had lots of opportunity to talk about maps and the way that they distort things. An important distinction that came up is the difference between bending a surface around in space (which won't change the inner geometry) and the actual curvature of a surface.

We talked about the Lambert projection and the Mercator projection a bit, too.

From Shifrin \\(\S\\)2.1: Corbyn did \#10; TJ did \#9; we discussed the set-up for \#13.
