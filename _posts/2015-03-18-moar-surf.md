title: Catching Up! Spring Break Edition

---

As the week ended, we lost all momentum and didn't get a lot done. But most of you turned in project papers, and that is a good thing.

When we come back from break, I want to talk through Shifrin section 2.2 and Struik sections 2-4 through 2-8. This is the theory of curvature for a surface. We will try to parallel the development for curves by studing the motion of the normal vector in a neighborhood of a point. In the end this will give us shape information, and really only rely on second derivatives of the parameterization.
