title: Back To Work
---

Back from break, and back to work.

We had two computational presentations: Corbyn did Shifrin 2.2.3b and Emily did Shifrin 2.2.3d.

We talked a bunch about what the Gauss map is and considered examples (a hyperbolic paraboloid, a cylinder).

I would really like to finish section 2.2 as fast as possible so we can get to _geometry_.
