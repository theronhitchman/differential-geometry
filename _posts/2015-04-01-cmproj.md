title: Corbyn's presentation and Gauss' idea
---

Corbyn gave the presentation on his project for curves. This bit about treating the
framing as a rigid body and studying the rotational motion as a physicist does is
neat. So, we learned about the concept of areal velocity and saw the Darboux vector.
By the way, Gaston Darboux was an important French geometer.

Then we talked a little about effective LaTeX.

Then I shared a little bit about Gauss, the father of modern differential geometry
(and lots of other bits of mathematics). The neat thing here is to realize that
while doing a survey of Hanover, Gauss though about the surface of the land by
visualizing its normal lines as picking out points on "the sphere of the heavens".
This is where the Gauss map gets its start. Gaussian curvature is then interpreted
as a "local scaling factor of area under the Gauss map." The bit where we can
compute it as the determinant of the shape operator is then a theorem. Either way,
this is a cool way to think about surfaces.

Next time, Christine will give a short presentation about Bertrand Curves. And I hope we
will talk some more about surfaces. (hint, hint)
