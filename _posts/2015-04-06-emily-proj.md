title: Emily Presents
---

Emily presented about the tangent spherical image of a curve. This is a bit like a
curves version of the Gauss map.

Jesse presented Shifrin 2.2\#13.

Then I talked about what will come next: using the tangential components of the second
derivatives \\(x_{uu}\\), etc. This leads us to introduce the _Christoffel symbols_ and
find a way to compute them.

Please read up on section 2.3 of Shifrin and start exercises there.
