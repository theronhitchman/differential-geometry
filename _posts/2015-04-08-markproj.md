title: Mark's Project
---

Mark shared with us his work on a project to describe curves which live on quadric surfaces
by a differential equation using only curvature and torsion.

Then we jumped into talking about Christoffel symbols! We discussed several exercises
from Shifrin section 2.3: Christine did \#1 and #2a. Mark did \#4. Emily started to do \#2c,
but asked for a redo.

Next time, Sladana will share her project with us, and we'll do more about local geometry of
surfaces.
