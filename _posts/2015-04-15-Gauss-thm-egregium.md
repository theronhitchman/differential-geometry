title: Gauss' Theorema Egregium
---

Sladana presented Shifrin 2.3\# 2b, Emily presented 2.3\#12. This gave me the
opportunity to talk about Gauss' Theorema Egregium. This is a central result of
classical differential geometry, and one of the motivating results for modern
differential (Reimannian) geometry.

We had volunteers for the parts of \#7. Let's do that next time.

Start reading section 2.4. I'll bring project descriptions with entry points in the
literature next time.
