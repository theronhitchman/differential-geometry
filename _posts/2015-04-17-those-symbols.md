title: Last Day to work on Christoffel symbols
---

Our discussion started with student presentations today:
  - Jesse M did Shifrin 2.3 \#6
  - Corbyn did \#7a
  - Christine did \#7b
  - Emily did \#7c...sorta.

Then we talked about project ideas, and we talked about the idea of a geodesic.

Formal project descriptions coming in class tomorrow morning.

I want to have an exam on Friday about basic surface computations.
