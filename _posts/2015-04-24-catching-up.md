This post covers two class meetings.

April 22: Emily presented Shifrin 2.4\#1.

TJ talked about covariant derivatives, directional derivatives, writing a vector
field as a linear combination of \\(x_u, x_v\\), and writing a curve in local
coordinates.

...and we ran out of time.

April 24: Exam Day!
