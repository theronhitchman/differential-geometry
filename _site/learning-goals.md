# Learning Goals for Differential Geometry

Classical differential geometry is the study of curves and surfaces in Euclidean
space using tools from multivariable calculus and linear algebra. What follows is
a description of the expected learning goals for the course, organized by the
"Big Questions" that frame the subject.

  1. How do we describe (smooth) geometric objects so that we can use calculus
     to study them?

  2. What does the geometry of an object look like from the outside of the object?
     That is, how can we understand the way that the object sits in space?

  3. What does the geometry of an object look like from the inside of the object?
     That is, what geometric properties can be perceived by a creature whose
     whole universe is the object, and all of whose motion and perception is bound
     to the object itself?

  4. In what ways can be distinguish between two objects using geometric information?

  5. Is it possible to completely describe some objects by some simple geometric
     information? Does this work for any special classes of objects?

  6. What are the signature examples that help us see the possible geometries?


There are two further themes to deal with, and each is inextricably bound up in all
of the above:

  * Local properties, that can measured in (small) neighborhoods of a particular point,
    versus global properties, that can only be measured by considering the object
    as a whole.

  * Usually, we have one set of answers for curves, and another set of answers
    for surfaces.
