title: Specifications for the Curves Competency Exam
---

The purpose of this in-class, pen &amp; paper exam is to check that you know how
to deal with the basic technical computations in the theory of curves.

* the meaning of a parameterized curve as a geometric object and as a function
* computing arclength and reparametrizing curves by arclength
* the Frenet-Serret apparatus \\(\{T, N, B, \kappa, \tau\}\\) for a space curve
   + for unit-speed curves
   + for non-unit-speed curves
* basic interpretation of all of those objects

Students earn a passing credit for demonstrating competence with all four of those.
