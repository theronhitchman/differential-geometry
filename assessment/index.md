title: Assessment
---

This term we will use an assessment system called _Specifications Grading_. Every
assignment will be graded on a strictly pass/fail basis, and your final course grade
will be determined by the number of assignments you complete.

There are three types of credit-bearing work in this course:

+ Publishing solved problems in the class journal.
+ refereeing for the class journal.
+ larger projects on a topic negotiated with me.
+ Computational Competency Exams (One for Curves, Two for surfaces)

For more about the projects, please see the [projects page]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/).
For details about writing up solutions for the class journal, see the [writing page]({{site.baseurl}}/writing/)

### The grading table for undergraduates

Final grades will be assigned according to the following table:

### The grading table for graduate students

Final grades will be assigned according to the following table. Note that things are adjusted up slightly
to reflect higher expectations for graduate students. For graduate students one project must be of the
literature research type.
