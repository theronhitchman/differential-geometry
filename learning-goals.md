# Learning Goals for Differential Geometry

Classical differential geometry is the study of curves and surfaces in Euclidean
space using tools from multivariable calculus and linear algebra. What follows is
a description of the expected learning goals for the course, organized by the
"Big Questions" that frame the subject.

### Question One:
