\maketitle

\section*{Central Theme}

There are special cases of surfaces that are interesting: Ruled surfaces, which contain enough straight lines so that there is a line in the surface through each point; and surfaces built as envelopes of families of planes.

\section*{Minimum Requirements}

Write a paper exploring the basics of these special classes of surfaces built by using constructions with curves. 
\begin{compactitem}
\item 7-10 pages, in \LaTeX, with attention paid to standard English grammar, spelling and usage.
\item Give a clear definition of each of these classes.
\item Compute several examples.
\item Include images where appropriate.
\item Prove the basic classification theorems for ruled surfaces and developable surfaces.
\end{compactitem}


\section*{Resources}

Shifrin has a discussion of ruled surfaces and the classification theorem in section 2.1 exercise \#12.

Struik has a good discussion of developable surfaces as section 2-4.

Another good reference is do Carmo's \emph{Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces} chapter 3-5.A.
