title: Projects

Differential Geometry gives us lots of opportunity for further study on special
topics. Depending on which grade you are aiming for, you will complete projects
of various types that allow you to go deeper into special parts of the subject.

## Styles of Projects

1. A Literature Research Project

   Choose an article from an expository journal which addresses some topic in
   classical differential geometry of curves or surfaces. Appropriate
   journals include:

     * The American Mathematical Monthly
     * The Mathematical Intelligencer
     * The College Mathematics Journal
     * Mathematics Magazine

   One could also choose a topic not on our study list, but that appears in a
   standard reference work in differential geometry.
   Then write your understanding of the work for a different audience.

2. A Creative Project

   Make something that displays an idea we have studied somehow. Ideas for
   things one could make:

     * An animation, or interactive widget about a theorem or construction.
       This should show off some truly visual part of the subject in an
       interesting way.
     * Some physical model of an idea or theorem we study. Make it out of
       paper, cardboard, etc. or 3d print it.

## Ideas for Project Topics

There are _lots_ of reasonable things one could do here. I'll just make a short
list to help you get started looking for ideas.

#### Curves

Bertrand Mates, Which way did the bicycle go?, contact between curves, involutes
and evolutes, the isoperimetric problem, spherical images, Fenchel and FÃ¡ry-Milnor
theorems, other connections to knot theory, the Cauchy-Crofton formula, Hopf's
Umlaufsatz, Ovals and the four vertex theorem, planes curves of constant width,
the Darboux vector, pedal curves, the Bishop framing.

#### Surfaces

The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, Minimal surfaces, calculus of variations and geodesics,
The Hopf-Rinow theorem, the geodesic flow, ruled surfaces, Hilbert's theorem,
Liebmann's theorem, Minding's theorem, complete surfaces of constant curvature,
surfaces of constant width, Jacobi's last geometric "theorem", the Beltrami-Enneper
theorem, Clairaut's theorem, Mirrors, Maps, the Rodriguez formula and Bonnet's
theorem on lines of curvature

There are so many topics, that you can easily find a whole bunch more. This is
just a list I made up in an afternoon of thinking.
