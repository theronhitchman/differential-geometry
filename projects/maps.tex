\section*{Central Theme}

Parametrizations of the sphere give us interesting maps of the Earth. Which ones have good geometric properties?

\section*{Minimum Requirements}

Write a paper exploring some examples of parametrizations of a sphere as pertains to map-making. 
\begin{compactitem}
\item 7-10 pages, in \LaTeX, with attention paid to standard English grammar, spelling and usage.
\item Find and describe several different types of parametrizations which have interesting geometric properties.
\item Include images where appropriate.
\item Prove the properties of the maps which are interesting!
\end{compactitem}

\section*{Extension}

Can you make good maps of South America using each of the styles you choose to explore?

\section*{Resources}

The wikipedia page for ``map projections" has lots of interesting things. 

\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections}

The conformal mapping section of Struik has good information. ch 5 section 3.

Be sure to explore at least one conformal map, at least one equi-areal map, and at least one gnomonic projection map. A polyconic one might be neat, too.
