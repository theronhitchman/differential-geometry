*Differential Geometry*<br />
*Math 3630/5630, Spring 2015*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical differential geometry: the study of curves and
surfaces in space using tools from calculus and linear algebra.

We will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL] (IBL) environment, with
student presentations of their own work at the center of our daily routine.

Successful students will (1) learn to compute geometric quantities using multivariable
calculus, (2) learn to connect those quantities with geometric features of curves and
surfaces, and (3) complete a project or two while exploring more advanced geometry
of curves and surfaces.

## Materials:

- Texts:
    * Course pack
    * Struik

## Assessment:

I will be using a "specifications grading" scheme for this course. See the
[relevant handout][specs] for more detailed information. Grades in this course are based
on the following assessments:

- in-class participation, focusing on finding and presenting arguments, and publishing in the class journal
- work as a referee for the class journal
- computational fluency exams
- large projects:
    * Literature reading projects, based on reading mathematical journal articles
    * Creative projects, where students make something related to the course material

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please contact me.

## Dates to Observe: (These are tentative)

- Feb 6: First Project proposal due
- Feb 13: exam on basic curve computations
- March 6: exam on basic surface computations
- March 13: First Project Due
- March 27: Second Project proposal due
- April 3: exam on advanced surface computations
- May 4-8: Final Exam Week -- we'll have a project presentation day!

**Accommodations:**
  If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact the
  instructor early in the semester so that your learning needs may be
  appropriately met. You will need to provide documentation of your
  disability to the Student Disability Services (SDS) office, located on the
  top floor of the Student Health Center, (319) 273-2677.

**Academic Learning Center Syllabus Statement**
  I encourage you to utilize the Academic Learning Center’s free assistance with
  writing, math, science, college reading, and learning strategies. UNI’s Academic
  Learning Center, located in 007/008 ITTC, also provides advising services and
  is the University's testing center for many standardized tests, including the
  PLT, GRE, and Praxis Core. Visit the website at `http://www.uni.edu/unialc/` or
