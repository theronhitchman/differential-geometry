*Differential Geometry*<br />
*Math 3630/5630, Spring 2015*


##Course Description:

This course is devoted to classical differential geometry: the study of curves and
surfaces in space using tools from calculus and linear algebra.

We will run class as an [Inquiry Based Learning][IBL] (IBL) environment, with
student presentations of their own work at the center of our daily routine.

Successful students will

## Assessment:

I will be using a "specifications grading" scheme for this course. See the
[relevant handout][specs] for more detailed information. Grades in this course are based
on the following assessments:

- in-class participation, focusing on finding and presenting arguments, and publishing in the class journal
- work as a referee for the class journal
- computational fluency exams
- large projects:
    * Literature reading projects, based on reading mathematical journal articles
    * Creative projects, where students make something related to the course material

If you feel uncertain about your progress in the course at any time, please contact me.
