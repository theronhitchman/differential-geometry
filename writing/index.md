## About the Class Journal
As part of the work of this course, we will make a mathematical journal with
the students in the course as the authors, referees, and readers. I will play
the role of managing editor.

When you have successfully presented a result and defended it to the class,
you will then write a mathematical paper to share your results in definitive
form. A mathematical paper has a certain format to it, so to help you along,
I have created a template as a Overleaf.com document. Professional journals
choose specific styles that authors must adhere to as a way of giving their
printed work a visual distinctiveness.


I have arranged with a service called _Overleaf_ to provide you with a simple
online template for writing papers. You can find a fresh copy by clicking the
link below:

[THE OVERLEAF.COM TEMPLATE FOR WRITING PAPERS][template]


_To submit a paper_, send an email to the address **theron.hitchman@uni.edu**
with the subject line in the form **Euclidean Geometry Task ##** where you
replace the ##'s with the proper identifier for the task. From Overleaf there
is an option to download a pdf copy of your paper. Please rename it in the form
**LastName-Task-##.pdf** and attach it to your message.

I advise you to make a (free!) account at Overleaf.com so you can make use
of these links and keep your papers together.

## Specifications for Grading:

To earn credit, a paper must:

* Adhere to reasonably Standard Written English usage for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
* Be complete and clearly presented.
* Clearly state which problem is being solved.
* Pass through a peer-review process, where either Prof Hitchman or a classmate plays role of
  referee.

At the time a paper is turned in, the referee's name should be sent in, too.

### About being a referee

Eventually, a classmate will ask you to play the role of referee. Your job in this instance
is to help that person write a better paper. Read it carefully and make comments.
Check to see that the work will earn credit!

Also, save your set of comments. You may need these later to prove that you were
the referee.
